- [ ] everytime there is throw new Error in javascript, that means that I need
  to send an error report
- [ ] when manual payment is submitted, inputs should be emptied
- [ ] implement dev mode. Show a fat warning at the top, but allow for empty passwords
- [ ] this whole concept of login/signup for the server is bad, because that
  means that when I introduce a new feature, I have to delete the data/ folder
  and restart from scratch (which is obviously not possible in prod). So, every
  componenent should automatically detect whether the file it needs exist, and
  if not, then create it (maybe log something out too)
- [ ] make cryptor require streams (that it'll then convert to byte) so that when we actually swap to streams, it's easy
- [ ] make a simple endpoint /errorreport or something, and send post request
  on it. Make a util function on the client

- [ ] delete a store file
- [ ] change password
- [ ] change keys (without changing password)
- [ ] implement a warning system

- [x] store location should be configurable
- [x] there is one file per salt, but one file for every key... they should all be in one file
- [x] switch for to scrypt for password hashing
- [x] validate password
- [x] fix the test!!
- [x] salt should be in it's own file, and it should be automatically generated if it doesn't exists

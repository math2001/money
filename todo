- [ ] validate password
- [ ] switch for to scrypt for password hashing
- [ ] delete a store file
- [ ] store location should be configurable
- [ ] change password
- [ ] change keys (without changing password)
- [ ] there is one file per salt, but one file for every key... they should all be in one file

- [x] fix the test!!
- [x] salt should be in it's own file, and it should be automatically generated if it doesn't exists
